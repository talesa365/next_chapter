            <h4>The Story</h4>
            <p>
            The sound of the heavy metal door closing brought it all back. The cold metal bars, the fences lined with razor wire, the women yelling, the officers’ keys jangling – these are the sounds of a prison sentence. I was inmate #997226 with the Indiana Department of Correction, broken, and battered. I had spent most of my life in poverty struggling with domestic violence and addiction. I never expected that in this chaos and concrete I would be rebuilt.
            In 2018, I was introduced to The Last Mile’s Web Development Program, which equips participants with in-demand technology skills. I was 1 of 6 women selected for the first cohort of The Last Mile in Indiana. I had no prior experience with web development and no access to the internet, yet I learned to build full stack applications from start to finish. After pushing myself, embracing and overcoming challenges, and continually striving to support and uplift my fellow classmates, I graduated at the top of my class with my capstone chosen to present to the Workforce Advisory Board including the President and CEO of Walmart and Apple. Six weeks after graduating, I was released. Daily I battled the imposter system. But I was determined to go after the career I had been dreaming of inside that coding program. It happened, I was offered and accepted a job as the Systems Analyst & Webmaster with the Indiana Department of Correction.

            <h4>The Challenge</h4>
            <p>
            The challenge of returning to school and learning new technology such as data science later in life has been a real struggle, but also empowering.  I am doing my best at adapting to the rigorous demands of work and school. I’ve found that storytelling through data offers me a creative outlet and a way to make meaningful contributions. Age and background are obstacles, but they are also what make my perspective unique.
            For me, a dream job would be one where I can use data to tell stories that make an impact, whether in social justice, criminal reform, or beyond into the sports world. My long-term goal is to work in a role that allows me to bridge the gap between abstract data and real-world impact.This is where I see myself making a difference.
